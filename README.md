# KeyMaster

A game to port to every single console imaginable

Built with raylib.

# Running/Compiling

## Windows:

Run CMD, goto the project dir, then type `make` and then type `bin\KeyMaster`

## Linux and macOS:

Run Terminal, goto the project dir, then type `make linux` and then type `./bin/KeyMaster`

# Notes:

* The sprites aren't the best...

* The controls are arrow keys

* I didn't want to make more levels so maybe ill work on that later or something

* If it doesn't compile, then create a bin directory in the project dir

* Make sure you launch it as `./bin/KeyMaster`, not `./KeyMaster`
